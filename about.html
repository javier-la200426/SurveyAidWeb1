                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>SurveyAid was born from a simple observation: while working with NGOs in developing countries, I noticed that many organizations were still using paper-based surveys or basic online forms that didn't capture the nuanced data they needed to make informed decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p>After witnessing the challenges of manual data collection and analysis, I decided to create a solution that would make professional survey creation as easy as having a conversation. The result was SurveyAid - a platform that uses AI to help organizations create culturally appropriate, multilingual surveys in seconds.</p>
